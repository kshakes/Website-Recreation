# CoinMarketCap API Pricing Page

After learning the flexbox and grid display in HTML, I thought it would be great practice to try and replicate this page as it includes many different features and elements. For example, different font sizes, margins, padding, font colour, alignment of divs and text and many more. So the use of classes and some ID's were crutial.

## My Final Outcome

After my attempt at recreating the page, I was very pleased as it is the first time i've put my skills that I am still developing into use. Currently, I am in the process of studying a Udemy course from Dr. Angela on how to become a full stack developer. With the skills I have gained from up to Section 10, I was able to comfortably recreate a section from a website. 

## Improvements
After reviewing the source code of CMC at the end of my attempt, I noticed that they separated the heading of the box ("Basic" and "Basic personal use" for example in the first box) and the rest of the box. This is good as it may help with alignment and making changes without having to modify individual components. This is something ill take on board on my next challenge.
